   <title>Unwrapping Producer Methods</title>
   
   <para>
      Unwrapping producer methods allow you to create injectable objects that have "self-managed"" lifecycles, and are 
      particularly useful if you have need a bean whose lifecycle does not exactly match one of the lifecycle of one of
      the existing scopes. The lifecycle of the bean is are managed by the bean that defines the producer method, and 
      changes to the unwrapped object are immediately visible to all clients.
   </para>
   
   <para>
      You can declare a method to be an unwrapping producer method by annotating it <code>@Unwraps</code>. The return 
      type of the managed producer must be proxyable (see Section 5.4.1 of the CDI specification, "Unproxyable bean 
      types"). Every time a method is called on unwrapped object the invocation is forwarded to the result of calling
      the unwrapping producer method - the unwrapped object.
   </para>

         Seam Solder implements this by injecting a proxy rather than the original object. Every invocation on the
         injected proxy will cause the unwrapping producer method to be invoked to obtain the instance on which to 
         invoke the method called. Seam Solder will then invoke the method on unwrapped instance. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Because of this, it is very important the producer method is lightweight.

   <para>
      For example consider a permission manager (that manages the current permission), and a security manager (that 
      checks the current permission level). Any changes to permission in the permission manager are immediately visible
      to the security manager. 
   </para>
   
   <programlisting role="JAVA">@SessionScoped
class PermissionManager {
   
   Permission permission;
  
   void setPermission(Permission permission) {
      this.permission=permission;
   }
  
   @Unwraps @Current
   Permission getPermission() {
      return this.permission;
   }
}</programlisting>

<programlisting role="JAVA">@SessionScoped
class SecurityManager {
   
   @Inject @Current
   Permission permission;
  
   boolean checkAdminPermission() {
      return permission.getName().equals("admin");
   }

}</programlisting>

   <para>
      When <code>permission.getName()</code> is called, the unwrapped Permission forwards the invocation of 
      <code>getName()</code> to the result of calling <code>PermissionManager.getPermission()</code>.
   </para>

   <para>
      For example you could raise the permission level before performing a sensitive operation, and then lower it again 
      afterwards:
   </para>
   
   <programlisting role="JAVA">public class SomeSensitiveOperation {
   
   @Inject
   PermissionManager permissionManager;
  
   public void perform() {
      try {
         permissionManager.setPermission(Permissions.ADMIN);
         // Do some sensitive operation
      } finally {
         permissionManager.setPermission(Permissions.USER);
      }
   }

}</programlisting>

   <para>
      Unwrapping producer methods can have parameters injected, including <code>InjectionPoint</code> (which repreents)
      the calling method.
   </para>
